with all the grades being erased from the courses. To login, select if you are a teacher/assistant, student or parent and enter your name.
The app is interactive, teachers can confirm grades that have been read from the input file and only then students will be able to see it
and parents will receive the notification. The graphic interphace is made using basic Swing.
